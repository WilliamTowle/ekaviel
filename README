General:
- source shall not exist in the top level directory
- builds shall not take place in the source tree (treat it read-only)
- builds shall not create their final targets in the top level
 
The top level makefile:
- shall define at least the virtual targets 'help', 'default', and 'all'
- shall define the virtual target 'default' first, with a sensible result
- shall define rules to make temporary directories
- shall 'include' new build rules via 'include' files in source tree
- making 'clean' shall remove temporary files, leaving "installable" ones
- making 'realclean' shall remove the build tree (not source/top level)

Include files for final executables/libraries:
- shall have a virtual target as an entry point
- shall have rules for only real-file targets otherwise
- shall have local variables for defines/includes/link flags
- shall make other 'includes' for associated library targets/define settings
- shall auto-generate a dependency file if complexity warrants

Executables/libraries with auto-generated dependency files:
- dependency generation shall use all relevant local define/include variables
- the "entry point" build rule shall directly prompt build of dependencies
- shall directly include the dependency file, after an existence test
- shall use ${MAKE} in virtual target to build 'include'd real-file targets

Executables/libraries without dependencies:
- the "entry point" rule shall prompt compilation of the final output file
